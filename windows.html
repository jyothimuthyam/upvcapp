            <h3>TILT AND TURN WINDOWS</h3>
            <p>Tilt and Turn windows are extremely popular in apartments or locations where external access for cleaning
                is a problem. <br><br>

                The unique concealed hardware means there are no external hinges, unlike other tilt and turn systems
                ensuring smooth clear lines and also offers greater security than face fit hinges. The window is ideal
                for apartments, flats or other areas where external access is limited allowing the window to tilt
                inwards for ventilation and then when needed to be opened (turn) fully for cleaning from within the
                property. It can also double as a means of escape in the event of emergency. <br><br>

                The sash opens inward in two different ways: <br>

                Tilt Position, which gives good ventilation without compromising safety <br>

                Turn Position, allows for easy cleaning or a clear fire escape opening</p> <br>
